Carry out several calls with only one RPC call.

```shell
go get github.com/omnes-tech/multicall
```

## At a Glance

Instantiate the multicall client:
```go
client, err := multicall.NewClient(multicall.GENERAL, "http://localhost:8545", nil)
if err!= nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

Now you just need to call any method you need!

Write (transaction) functions:
- `AggregateCalls`
- `TryAggregateCalls`
- `TryAggregateCalls3`

Read (call) functions:
- `SimulateCall`
- `AggregateStatic`
- `TryAggregateStatic`
- `TryAggregateStatic3`
- `CodeLengths`
- `Balances`
- `AddressesData`
